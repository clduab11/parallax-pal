# Implementation Roadmap for Parallax Pal Refactor

This document outlines a phased approach to transform Parallax Pal into a fully web-based research tool with a CLI-style GUI and continuous research mode. It includes strategies for integrating fallback local models (Ollama-based) and scaling for 100+ concurrent users. The roadmap covers frontend and backend updates, architectural changes, security enhancements, deployment tactics, and code cleanup.

## Milestone 1: Frontend CLI-Style Web GUI

**Objective:**  
Refactor or rebuild the frontend in React to create an ASCII-rich terminal interface that enables an interactive research experience.

**Tasks:**
- **Assess Current UI:**  
  Review the existing React codebase in `src/frontend`. Identify reusable components and decide on new ones.
- **Design Terminal-Like Theme:**  
  - Establish an ASCII/terminal aesthetic using CSS.
  - Use monospaced fonts, high-contrast colors (green/amber on black, etc.), and ASCII borders.
  - Consider integrating TuiCss as inspiration.
- **Implement CLI Components:**  
  - Create a text input area (prompt) at the bottom.
  - Develop a scrollable output window above that shows all results sequentially.
  - Add support for ASCII banners/logos and enhance the visual feedback (e.g., blinking cursor).
- **Interactive UX Features:**  
  - Ensure basic keyboard navigation and command history.
  - Make the interface responsive for various screen sizes.
- **Integration with Backend:**  
  - Set up API calls (REST/WebSockets) from React to the backend endpoints (Milestone 2).
- **Testing & Tuning:**  
  - Test with various queries.
  - Refine styling and user experience based on feedback.

## Milestone 2: Backend API & WebSocket Integration

**Objective:**  
Develop a robust backend using FastAPI to handle search queries and real-time communication.

**Tasks:**
- **Choose Backend Framework:**  
  Use FastAPI for REST and WebSocket endpoints.
- **Architect the Backend Modules:**  
  - Search Orchestrator: Delegates queries to various search APIs.
  - Results Analyzer: Summarizes and filters search results.
  - Session Manager: Tracks continuous research sessions.
- **Implement Search Engine API Integrations:**
  - Google Custom Search API.
  - Tavily API for LLM-optimized searches.
  - DuckDuckGo API for quick ideas.
- **API Endpoints:**  
  - `POST /query` for one-time search queries.
  - `POST /continuous` to start continuous research sessions.
  - `POST /stop` to halt ongoing sessions.
  - `GET /results/{session_id}` to fetch session summaries.
- **WebSocket Endpoint:**  
  Create `/ws` for pushing real-time updates to the frontend.
- **Maintain CLI Fallback:**  
  Integrate the local Ollama model to be used when in CLI mode.
- **Unit Testing:**  
  Write tests (using FastAPI’s TestClient/pytest) to validate endpoints and WebSocket flows.

## Milestone 3: Continuous Research Mode Engine

**Objective:**  
Develop an autonomous research engine that iteratively searches, analyzes, and summarizes information until stopped by the user.

**Tasks:**
- **Design the Engine Workflow:**
  1. Accept an initial query/topic.
  2. Perform search (via APIs from Milestone 2).
  3. Retrieve top results with content/snippets.
  4. Use an LLM to summarize each result.
  5. Generate follow-up queries based on the findings.
  6. Loop iteratively until user stops the process.
- **Implement the Iterative Search Loop:**  
  - Implement using asynchronous background tasks in FastAPI.
  - Provide live updates over WebSocket.
  - Include a stop flag for graceful termination.
- **Result Filtering & De-Duplication:**  
  - Filter out redundant or irrelevant information.
  - Maintain a list of processed results.
- **LLM Integration for Summarization & Query Generation:**  
  - Use GPT-4/3.5 API or local Ollama for summarization.
  - Batch process summarization tasks where needed.
- **Efficiency Considerations:**  
  - Optimize GPU utilization and introduce throttling between iterations.
  - Monitor resource usage during extensive research sessions.
- **Summarization Output:**  
  - Aggregate findings into a running summary.
  - Display updates in the CLI-style output.

## Milestone 4: Cloud Deployment & Scalability

**Objective:**  
Deploy Parallax Pal on a scalable cloud infrastructure capable of handling 100+ concurrent users.

**Tasks:**
- **Select Cloud Platform:**  
  Choose between AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure based on team familiarity and cost.
- **Containerize the Application:**
  - Create Docker images for the FastAPI backend and the React frontend.
  - Ensure dependencies and environment configurations are included.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration:**  
  - Define Kubernetes deployments for backend and frontend.
  - Configure services and ingress controllers (supporting WebSockets).
  - Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
- **Load Testing & Scalability Validation:**  
  - Simulate high concurrent usage using tools like Locust or JMeter.
  - Monitor autoscaling events.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  - Implement automated builds and deployments via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
  - Push Docker images to a container registry.
  - Automate testing and deployment on merge events.
- **Infrastructure as Code:**  
  Use Terraform or similar tools to codify the cloud infrastructure setup.

## Milestone 5: Security & Performance Hardening

**Objective:**  
Enhance security, integrity, and performance ensuring robust operations in production environments.

**Tasks:**
- **API Rate Limiting:**  
  - Implement rate limiting using FastAPI middleware (e.g., slowapi or fastapi-limiter with Redis).
  - Protect against DDoS attacks by enforcing per-user/IP limits.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:**  
  - Serve resources over HTTPS.
  - Use certificates from Let’s Encrypt or cloud provider’s certificate manager.
- **Data Encryption at Rest:**  
  - Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 or similar.
  - Ensure storage volumes and databases are encrypted.
- **Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana:**  
  - Expose metrics from backend services.
  - Set up Grafana dashboards to monitor key performance indicators.
  - Configure alerts for critical conditions.
- **Structured Logging & Error Tracking:**  
  - Implement logging with Python’s logging module.
  - Integrate with log aggregators or error tracking systems (such as Sentry).
- **Penetration Testing & Audit:**  
  - Run security tests and address OWASP vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in code or logs.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Introduce caching for expensive LLM summarizations.
  - Optimize backend performance parameters (e.g., Uvicorn settings).
  - Use CDN for serving static frontend assets.

## Milestone 6: Code Audit & Cleanup

**Objective:**  
Conduct a comprehensive audit and cleanup of the entire codebase before the final production launch.

**Tasks:**
- **Remove Unused Dependencies:**  
  - Identify and remove libraries no longer needed.
  - Specifically remove the "harbor" dependency and related modules.
- **Code Quality Review:**  
  - Refactor complex functions for clarity and maintainability.
