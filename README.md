# Parallax Pal: AI-Powered Research Assistant üîç

## Overview

Parallax Pal is an advanced AI research assistant that transforms complex research queries into structured, comprehensive insights. Unlike traditional chatbots, this tool methodically breaks down research questions, explores web sources, and synthesizes findings with unprecedented depth and precision.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Intelligent Research Planning**: Automatically creates prioritized research focus areas
- **Systematic Web Exploration**: Performs targeted searches and content extraction
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generates detailed research documents with source URLs
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously refines research approach based on discovered information
- **Interactive Q&A**: Enables in-depth exploration of research findings

## How Parallax Pal Works üß†

1. **Input Research Query**: Provide a complex question or research topic
2. **Automated Analysis**: AI breaks down the query into focused research areas
3. **Web Exploration**: 
   - Generates targeted search queries
   - Retrieves and analyzes relevant web pages
   - Extracts key information systematically
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Compiles findings into a structured research document
5. **Continuous Refinement**: Iteratively explores new research angles
